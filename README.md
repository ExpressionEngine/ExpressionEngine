# ExpressionEngine CMS

ExpressionEngine is a mature, flexible, secure, free open-source content management system. It is beloved by designers for giving them complete control of all output, and by content authors for enabling reusable, high-performing content. With ExpressionEngine, you can build full-featured websites, create a web app, or serve content to mobile applications. All without requiring complex programming skills.

Visit [expressionengine.com](https://expressionengine.com/) to see what it's all about or, if you prefer, download a ZIP and jump right in!

## How to Get Started

ExpressionEngine separates your content from your design, enabling you to make small or large changes to your website with ease. Your content is stored in Channels, and your design is kept in Templates, both of which are entirely under your control. ExpressionEngine bends to _your_ needs, not the other way around like many other CMSes.
