/*!
 * ExpressionEngine Custom Interact jQuery Event
 */

/* Usage Notes:
 *
 * This file adds a custom event to jquery. The broadcast event
 * handles interactions between windows and tabs of the current
 * browser. It is useful for communicating global events, such
 * as showing the login modal when a tab becomes idle, or hiding
 * the sidebar across all windows.
 *
 * The postmessage api requires that you already have a reference
 * to the window object you're sending to. Since these cannot be
 * grabbed, we instead use Local Storage as a proxy. When a store
 * is changed, the "storage" event is fired on all tabs/windows
 * using the same item.
 *
 * We send along a unique ID for this window as well as the event
 * namespace if it exists. The message is sent through storage as
 * a json encoded string. This gives us a 44 byte overhead that
 * will be taken from the 4kb cookie limit. It is generally not
 * wise to send large messages.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * $(window).bind('broadcast', function(evt, message) {...});
 * $(window).trigger('broadcast', "My Message");
 *
