# Contributing

Hey, welcome! We're excited that you want to get involved in the ExpressionEngine project. There are lots of ways to get started: helping fellow users, reporting and triaging bugs, contributing code, help guide ExpressionEngine's future, and more! If you have an idea for how you can contribute to the ExpressionEngine project that isn't listed here, you are welcome to create a pull request with your changes to this guide.

Welcome aboard!

## Helping Fellow Users

One of the best and easiest ways to give back to the ExpressionEngine community is by answering questions and helping fellow users. Pay it forward and help new users get up to speed, or help other experts with challenging problems. Here's where you can find each other:

- the [Forums](https://expressionengine.com/forums)
- the official [Slack](https://expressionengine.com/community#slack)
- over at [StackExchange](https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com)
- on Twitter using the **#eecms** hashtag
- start or join a [local Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/expressionengine/)!

## Reporting Bugs

ðŸš¨ðŸ”’ðŸš¨ *If you have a **security issue** to report, **DO NOT** open an issue on GitHub. Please submit to our security and disclosure platform described in our user guide regarding [Security Reports](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/bugs_and_security_reports/index.html). Thanks!*

If you have found a bug, please first search the [existing Issues](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine/issues) to see if your problem has already been reported. If it has, and you have additional helpful information, please add it!

If your problem has not been reported yet, just [open an Issue](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine/issues) in the official GitHub repository. Here are some tips on filing good bug reports that can be addressed by code contributors. The Issue template will help remind of you of these pointers:

- **Use the latest version.** The ExpressionEngine project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), so make sure you are on the latest _patch_ release for the current major version. Bugs submitted for Legacy versions will be closed (see [Version Support](https://expressionengine.com/support/version-support)). All security reports, including for Legacy versions should be made through HackerOne (see above).

- **Include a good description of the problem.** For someone to fix your bug, they need to understand exactly what's happening. Describe what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

- **Include error messages.** If your problem throws error messages, cut and paste them verbatim; paraphrased error messages can make tracking down the problem more difficult. Please include the complete stack trace if the error included it.

- **Show how to reproduce the error.** You can do this by text, image, video, whatever is easiest for you to clearly show someone how to replicate this problem on ther own installation.

- **Include environmental details.** Include the ExpressionEngine, PHP, and MySQL version numbers. If you are working locally, include the web server and OS. If you are using MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP, please see if you can reproduce your problem on a managed environment. These packaged stack solutions while convenient are often configured in a way that creates problems you will not find on production servers.

## Triaging Bugs

Bug reports often need grooming before a code contributor can take ownership of a problem and fix it. Bugs get fixed rapidly when they are easy to reproduce and focus on a single issue. And the Issue tracker can get overwhelmed if there are many duplicate or similar reports.

Even if you can't write code, you can help triage bugs!

- **Confirm bugs.** A code contributor can't fix a bug that they can't reproduce. If the original report includes instructions to replicate, confirm that it is indeed reproducible. If that's been left out, ask the original submitter to add that information to their bug report. If you can reproduce it and the instructions to do so are clear, ping the maintainers in the comments (`@ExpressionEngine/Maintainers`) so they can apply an appropriate label.

- **Help people write good bug reports.** If you notice that a bug report is lacking detail, clarity, or any of the details under [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs), coach the submitter on what is missing and why it's important. Be kind and tactful, so they are encouraged to submit good bug reports in the future!

- **Identify duplicate issues.** If more than one report exists for the same root issue, ping the maintainers (`@ExpressionEngine/Maintainers`) in the comments to let them know the issue is a duplicate, and provide a reference to the original Issue
